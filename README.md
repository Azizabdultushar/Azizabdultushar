# Hi, I'm Abdul Aziz üëã

**Hardware Developer | Problem Solver | FPGA & Processor Architecture Enthusiast | EDA Operator | Terminal User**


Welcome to my GitHub! I‚Äôm passionate about building efficient hardware solutions, exploring processor architectures, and optimizing workflows with Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Whether it's writing low-level code, designing circuits, or automating tasks in the terminal, I'm always eager to solve complex problems and learn new technologies.

## üöÄ **What I Do**
- **Hardware Development:** Designing and optimizing digital circuits and embedded systems.
- **Processor Architecture:** Enthusiastic about microarchitecture design, pipelining, and instruction set optimization.
- **EDA Tools:** Proficient in using EDA tools for VLSI design, simulation, and verification.
- **Terminal Mastery:** Strong command-line skills for automation, scripting, and development workflows.

## üîß **Technical Skills**
- **Languages:** C++, Verilog, VHDL, Python, Shell Scripting.
- **Tools & Frameworks:** AMD Vivado‚Ñ¢ Design Suite, Synopsys, Cadence, Git, emacs.
- **Domains:** Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, FPGA Design, RTL Development.

## üìÇ **Highlighted Projects**
- **[RISC-V Processor Design](#):** Physical Design and Power Integrity Analysis of RISC-V Processor Cores.
- **[EDA Automation Scripts](#):** Automated Data Acquisition Program for Static IRDrop.
- **[Ultra low-power design](#):** Ultra low power FPGA design for deep sea application.

## üìà **Learning Goals**
- Advanced microarchitecture optimization techniques
- Custom ASIC design workflows
- Exploring open-source EDA tools
- Common power format (CPF) & Unified power format (UPF) scripting
